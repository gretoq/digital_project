This is a React application designed for desktop devices. It includes a main page, routing to other pages, and various placeholder pages with minimal content (only displaying page names). There's also an error page (Not Found page) for when users enter an invalid URL. Styling is done using SCSS, and the layout is currently optimized for desktop, with the potential for expansion to other platforms in the future.
